---We know that Samba is suitable for both Linux and Windows systems. In a network, each host participates in the same workgroup. A workgroup is a group name that identifies an arbitrary collection of computers and their resources on an SMB network.

                    ----smbclient
    ----Now we can display a list (-L) of the server's shares with the smbclient command from our host. We use the so-called null session (-N), which is anonymous access without the input of existing users or valid passwords.

                    $ smbclient -N -L //x.x.x.x


    !!!you can always try the guest account

                    $ smbclient ////x.x.x.x//{share}


    --Smbclient also allows us to execute local system commands using an exclamation mark at the beginning (!<cmd>) without interrupting the connection.
