			---Determine Firewall and their Rules


The packet could either be dropped or send a RST flag in an ICMP response

dropped packets gives an filtered state


ICMP Error Responses:

    -Net Unreachable
    -Net Prohibited
    -Host Unreachable
    -Host Prohibited
    -Port Unreachable
    -Proto Unreachable



Nmap's TCP ACK scan (-sA) method is much harder to filter for firewalls and IDS/IPS systems than regular SYN (-sS) or Connect scans (sT) because they only send a TCP packet with only the ACK flag. When a port is closed or open, the host must respond with an RST flag. Unlike outgoing connections, all connection attempts (with the SYN flag) from external networks are usually blocked by firewalls. However, the packets with the ACK flag are often passed by the firewall because the firewall cannot determine whether the connection was first established from the external network or the internal network.


Several virtual private servers (VPS) with different IP addresses are recommended to determine whether IPS/IDS systems are on the target network during a penetration testf the administrator detects such a potential attack on the target network, the first step is to block the IP address from which the potential attack comes. As a result, we will no longer be able to access the network using that IP address.One method to determine whether such IPS system is present in the target network is to scan from a single host (VPS). If at any time this host is blocked and has no access to the target network, we know that the administrator has taken some security measures.


			----Decoys

With this method, Nmap generates various random IP addresses inserted into the IP header to disguise the origin of the packet sent.We can generate random (RND) a specific number of IP addresses separated by a colon (:). Our real IP address is then randomly placed between the generated IP addresses.!!!decoys must be alive!!!!Otherwise, the service on the target may be unreachable due to SYN-flooding security mechanisms.
		sudo nmap x.x.x.x -p 80 -sS -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace -D RND:5


The spoofed packets are often filtered out by ISPs and routers, even though they come from the same network range. Therefore, we can also specify our VPS servers' IP addresses and use them in combination with "IP ID" manipulation in the IP headers to scan the target.

Another scenario would be that only individual subnets would not have access to the server's specific services. So we can also manually specify the source IP address (-S) to test if we get better results with this one. Decoys can be used for SYN, ACK, ICMP scans, and OS detection scans.

			----DNS Proxyfying

By default, Nmap performs a reverse DNS resolution unless otherwise specified to find more important information about our target. The DNS queries are made over the UDP port 53. The TCP port 53 was previously only used for the so-called "Zone transfers".More and more, this is changing due to IPv6 and DNSSEC expansions. These changes cause many DNS requests to be made via TCP port 53.

Nmap gives us a way to specify DNS servers ourselves 
				--dns-server <ns>,<ns>

The company's DNS servers are usually more trusted than those from the Internet. So, for example, we could use them to interact with the hosts of the internal network. As another example, we can use TCP port 53 as a source port (--source-port) for our scans.

You might also find out that IPS/IDS is weakly configured in this state so you could try enstablish connection through this rules
         ncat -nv --source-port 53 x.x.x.x port



				---Bypass IPS/IDS Techniques
	

-You can use -D RND:5 to generate 5 random decoy ip addresses and cloak the scan, then inject your own one as a 6th IP(that`s done automatically) to probe your target for open ports and possibly bypass ips/ids.You can also specify the decoy addresses as coma separated values and iclude ME as your own ip.If you dont,nmap is going to inject it randomly.

-The -S switch is telling nmap to spoof your ip address to the specified one and circumvent any subnet based firewall rules.Should be used together with -e and -Pn and you might not get many responses back.


-By using --source-port num you can specify the port wich nmap uses to probe your target.This comes in handy when inside a network some services are trusted actors in between the hosts.(Can`t be used for OS detection)

-You can specify a random ganerated sequence of n  bytes by appending the switch --data-lenght n


-Specifying the --ttl switch changes the time to live in IPv4 packets


-Another usefull method is to use the --proxies <Comma-separated list> switch which tells nmap to force conection between the target machine and the attacker through a SOCKS4 or HTTP proxy chain.Values should be in the format proto://host:port(Unsafe!)


-If you want to explicitly find the IPS behaviour you can use --badsum ,as if you get a response it would be for a such a system who didnt bother to check the checksum in ip header,since all ip stacks drop this packets
