- TCP Port 21 :connection enstablishment and commands
- TCP Port 20 : data tranfering

## Active FTP Connection


-    The client sends the PORT command to an FTP server. The source port is a random, high-numbered port. The destination port is 21.

-    The server responds with an ACK.

-    The server initiates a connection to the client with source port 20 and the destination port specified in the clientâ€™s PORT command.
-    The client sends an ACK to the server.  The FTP session has now been established.

## Passive FTP Conection




-    The client sends the PASV command to an FTP server on port 21. The source port is a random, high-numbered port. The destination port is 21.

-    The server responds with the PORT command. The port command specifies a random, high-numbered (ephemeral) port that the client can connect to.

-    The client initiates a connection to the server on this ephemeral port.

-    The server responds with an ACK. The FTP session has now been established



## TFTP

- UDP Port 69

Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is simpler than FTP and performs file transfers between client and server processes. However, it does not provide user authentication and other valuable features supported by FTP.

|Commands 	|Description|
|-----------|---------|
connect 	|Sets the remote host, and optionally the port, for file transfers.
get |	Transfers a file or set of files from the remote host to the local host.
put |	Transfers a file or set of files from the local host onto the remote host.
quit 	|Exits tftp.
status |	Shows the current status of tftp, including the current transfer mode (ascii or binary), connection status, time-out value, and so on.
verbose |	Turns verbose mode, which displays additional information during file transfer, on or off.
