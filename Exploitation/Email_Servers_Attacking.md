    
When we press the Send button in our email application (email client), the program establishes a connection to an SMTP server on the network or Internet. The name SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, and it is a protocol for delivering emails from clients to servers and from servers to other servers.

When we download emails to our email application, it will connect to a POP3 or IMAP4 server on the Internet, which allows the user to save messages in a server mailbox and download them periodically.


By default, POP3 clients remove downloaded messages from the email server. This behavior makes it difficult to access email on multiple devices since downloaded messages are stored on the local computer. However, we can typically configure a POP3 client to keep copies of downloaded messages on the server.

On the other hand, by default, IMAP4 clients do not remove downloaded messages from the email server. This behavior makes it easy to access email messages from multiple devices. Let's see how we can target mail servers.


# Enumeration


We can use the Mail eXchanger (MX) DNS record to identify a mail server. The MX record specifies the mail server responsible for accepting email messages on behalf of a domain name. It is possible to configure several MX records, typically pointing to an array of mail servers for load balancing and redundancy.

`$ host -t MX hackthebox.eu`

`$ dig mx inlanefreight.com | grep "MX" | grep -v ";"`


`$ host -t A mail1.inlanefreight.htb.`

# User Enum


The SMTP server has different commands that can be used to enumerate valid usernames VRFY, EXPN, and RCPT TO. If we successfully enumerate valid usernames, we can attempt to password spray, brute-forcing, or guess a valid password. So let's explore how those commands work.

`VRFY` this command instructs the receiving SMTP server to check the validity of a particular email username. The server will respond, indicating if the user exists or not. This feature can be disabled.

`$ telnet 10.10.110.20 25`

`# VRFY root`



`EXPN` is similar to VRFY, except that when used with a distribution list, it will list all users on that list. This can be a bigger problem than the VRFY command since sites often have an alias such as "all."

`RCPT TO` identifies the recipient of the email message. This command can be repeated multiple times for a given message to deliver a single message to multiple recipients.

```

$ telnet 10.10.110.20 25

MAIL FROM:test@htb.com
it is
250 2.1.0 test@htb.com... Sender ok

RCPT TO:julio

550 5.1.1 julio... User unknown

RCPT TO:john
250 2.1.5 john... Recipient ok
```

We can also use the POP3 protocol to enumerate users depending on the service implementation. For example, we can use the command USER followed by the username, and if the server responds OK. This means that the user exists on the server.


To automate our enumeration process, we can use a tool named [smtp-user-enum](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/smtp-user-enum). 

`$ smtp-user-enum -M RCPT -U userlist.txt -D inlanefreight.htb -t 10.129.203.7`



    

# Cloud Enumeration




[O365spray]((  https://github.com/0xZDH/o365spray   )) is a username enumeration and password spraying tool aimed at Microsoft Office 365 (O365) . This tool reimplements a collection of enumeration and spray techniques researched and identified by those mentioned in Acknowledgments.

      

`$ python3 o365spray.py --validate --domain msplaintext.xyz`


`$ python3 o365spray.py --enum -U users.txt --domain msplaintext.xyz `


# Password Attacks

    
`$ hydra -L users.txt -p 'Company01!' -f 10.10.110.20 pop3`


If cloud services support SMTP, POP3, or IMAP4 protocols, we may be able to attempt to perform password spray using tools like Hydra, but these tools are usually blocked. We can instead try to use custom tools such as o365spray or MailSniper for Microsoft Office 365 or CredKing for Gmail or Okta. Keep in mind that these tools need to be up-to-date because if the service provider changes something (which happens often), the tools may not work anymore. This is a perfect example of why we must understand what our tools are doing and have the know-how to modify them if they do not work properly for some reason.


`$ python3 o365spray.py --spray -U usersfound.txt -p 'March2022!' --count 1 --lockout 1 --domain msplaintext.xyz`





# Open Relay



`# nmap -p25 -Pn --script smtp-open-relay 10.10.11.213`

    Next, we can use any mail client to connect to the mail server and send our email.

`# swaks --from notifications@inlanefreight.com --to employees@inlanefreight.com --header 'Subject: Company Notification' --body 'Hi All, we want to hear from you! Please complete the following survey. http://mycustomphishinglink.com/' --server 10.10.11.213`
