The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used to transfer files between computers. It also performs directory and files operations, such as changing the working directory, listing files, and renaming and deleting directories or files. By default, FTP listens on port TCP/21.




# Enumeration

Nmap default scripts `-sC` includes the ftp-anon Nmap script which checks if a FTP server allows anonymous logins. The version enumeration flag `-sV` provides interesting information about FTP services, such as the FTP banner, which often includes the version name. We can use the ftp client or nc to interact with the FTP service. 


# Misconfigurations

Anonymous authentication can be configured for different services such as FTP. To access with anonymous login, we can use the anonymous username and no password.

```
$ ftp 192.168.2.142 

Name (192.168.2.142:kali): anonymous
```


# Protocol Specifics Attacks

### Brute Forcing

If there is no anonymous authentication available, we can also brute-force the login for the FTP services using a list of the pre-generated usernames and passwords. There are many different tools to perform a brute-forcing attack. Let us explore one of them, Medusa. With [Medusa](https://github.com/jmk-foofus/medusa), 


`$ medusa -u fiona -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -h 10.129.203.7 -M ftp `


### FTP Bounce Attack


An FTP bounce attack is a network attack that uses FTP servers to deliver outbound traffic to another device on the network. The attacker uses a PORT command to trick the FTP connection into running commands and getting information from a device other than the intended server.


The Nmap -b flag can be used to perform an FTP bounce attack:

`$ nmap -Pn -v -n -p80 -b anonymous:password@10.10.110.213 172.17.0.2`

Modern FTP servers include protections that, by default, prevent this type of attack, but if these features are misconfigured in modern-day FTP servers, the server can become vulnerable to an FTP Bounce attack.


# CoreFTP before build 727 vulnerability ( CVE-2022-22836 )

This vulnerability is for an FTP service that does not correctly process the HTTP PUT request and leads to an authenticated directory/path traversal, and arbitrary file write vulnerability. This vulnerability allows us to write files outside the directory to which the service has access.


This FTP service uses an HTTP POST request to upload files. However, the CoreFTP service allows an HTTP PUT request, which we can use to write content to files. The exploit for this attack is relatively straightforward, based on a single cURL command. 

`$ curl -k -X PUT -H "Host: <IP>" --basic -u <username>:<password> --data-binary "PoC." --path-as-is https://<IP>/../../../../../../whoops`
