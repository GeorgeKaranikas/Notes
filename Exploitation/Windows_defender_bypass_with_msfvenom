Typically an antivirus/EDR is using the above methods to detect a peace of malicious code or malicious executables

    -- Signature based detection 

        detecting mallware in which a unique identifier, normally a specific string of code,a sequence of bytes, or the hash of known malicious code, is established as associated with some piece of malware. 



        You can bypass signature based detection 

            - Custom payloads

            - obfuscating peace of malware

                    -encrypting /encoding
                    -Scrambling (mimikatz = MIMI + KAtZ)

    
    ---Heuristics/Behavioural based detection (Anomaly-Based Intrusion Detection)

        uses machine learning (ML) and statistical data to create a model of “normal” behavior. Anytime traffic deviates from this typical behavior, the system flags it as suspicious.



    -- Hybrid Intrusion Detection

        A hybrid system combines the best of both worlds. 


            You can bypass this with 

                -Polymorphism
                    is basically modyfiyng and randomizing the behaviour of the assymbly instructions


                -Custom payloads
